# /Sum/:
__Poly(hedron) Dice__ is quick/dirty dice roller for tabletop or forum-based games.  
It's design was directly focused on library independence and UI efficiency.

# /Featurae/:
* ~~X~~Copy-based installation with everything packed in single executible.
* Minimalistic Win98-inspired GUI with optional .ini-based field saving.
* d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d30, d100 support.

# /Reassembling/:
__PolyDice__ was written in plain [PureBasic v4.40](http://purebasic.com), though compatible with _5.40 (LTS)_.  
To rebuild - compile 'PolyDice.pb' as root sourcefile.
